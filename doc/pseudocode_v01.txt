Initialise the grid with the following user inputs:
    initial condition       (how the grid is populated at the moment it is created)                 (ic)
    boundary condition      (fixed operations applied after each step)                              (bc)
    update rule             (how cells are altered during an event)                                 (rule)
    perturbation scheme     (method of artificial interference with the system)                     (pert)
    dimensions              (the dimensions of the grid, currently supports 2 dimensions only)      (dim)

Default user inputs:
    ic      max30min10      (cells are given a value at random between 10 and 30)
    bc      cliff           (cells on the edge of the grid must have a value of 0)
    rule    BTW             (the rule described in the BTW paper)
    pert    random1         (a random cell's value is increased by 1)
    dim     25,25           (the grid has dimensions of 25 cells by 25 cells)

Run a simulation on the grid that executes the desired number of perturbations.

Issues:
    -The code currently only support two-dimensional grids. It should be generalised to n-dimensional arrays.
    -The lack of synchronicity may cause the occasional misfire of an event. I will investigate the "abelian sand pile" model to 
     hopefully resolve this.
